\begin{component}{About Me}
I am a recent Berkeley graduate interested in pursuing a PhD degree in Computer 
Science.

As an undergraduate, I quickly developed a keen interest in the field, 
and earnestly devoted myself to my studies. Wishing to examine the 
material at a deeper level, I pursued several 
teaching opportunities for a variety of undergraduate CS courses. My
most significant (and memorable) teaching experiences have occured while 
TA-ing the undergraduate CS 61A course, with both Brian Harvey and John
DeNero as instructors. Under Brian Harvey, I refined my teaching style, and
was greatly influenced by the positive learning environment encouraged by
Brian and reciprocated by the students. Later, with John DeNero, I participated
in developing the ``new'' 61A, taught in Python, where I helped develop
course materials such as discussion notes and exams.
Through these valuable teaching 
experiences, I developed a strong interest in teaching that I wish to
continue to nurture.

In addition, my desire to learn more about the CS field led me to
work with Professor David Wagner's ``Electronic Voting and Computer Vision''
research group, where we developed several tools and performed pilot audits
with various California counties, in addition to publishing at EVT/WOTE. Our major
contributions are systems in which Computer Vision algorithms and human
expertise is combined in order to reliably interpret ballot images. 
My work with
the research group sparked a strong interest in Computer 
Vision and, more generally, a desire to continue research in an
academic setting. There is a wide range of open research questions in the
Vision community that I hope to contribute to - a first step is to study the
field and contribute research in a Ph.D setting.

\begin{component}{What is Eric up to now?}

Since graduating last winter (December 2011), I have been continuing to work
in Professor Wagner's research group as a full-time researcher. Working in a
focused research environment has been an incredibly positive experience, and
is a motivating reason why I'd like to continue research in a graduate program. I've also
spent my time reading papers on the Vision field, in order to both broaden my
knowledge and get a sense of what the state-of-the-art is in the Vision
research community.

Due to my joint desire to continue working in research and teaching, I believe that pursuing
a Ph.D degree in Computer Science is the best fit for me.

``Operator-Assisted Tabulation of Optical Scan Ballots,'' Kai Wang, Eric Kim, Nicholas Carlini, Ivan Motyashov, Daniel Nguyen, David Wagner. \emph{EVT/WOTE 2012}, August 2012.
        \begin{itemize}
        \vspace{-0.5em}\item[] Developed a tool that allows an operator
to accurately and efficiently tabulate scanned ballots from an election,
via a system that interleaves Computer Vision algorithms and focused
operator assistance.
        \end{itemize}

``An Analysis of Write-in Marks on Optical Scan Ballots,'' Theron Ji, Eric Kim, Raji Srikantan, Alan Tsai, Arel Cordero, and David Wagner. \emph{EVT/WOTE 2011}, August 2011.
	\begin{itemize}
	\vspace{-0.5em}\item[] Developed a system to achieve automatic recognition of write-in marks on marked voter ballots. Evaluated the system on
				       a large-scale election in Leon County, Florida, and studied the kinds of write-in marks that are seen in practice.
