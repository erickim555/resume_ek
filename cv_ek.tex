\begin{component}{Research Interests}
Computer Vision, Machine Learning.
I am interested in identifying and developing principled general-purpose methods to
improve interpretation of both images and video streams. 
%In particular, I would like
%to develop methods that can scale to the billions of images available on the Internet.
%This includes unsupervised methods that can take effectively advantage of the large corpus of
%images without the expensive requirement of high-quality labels.
Specific applications range from object 
recognition, pedestrian detection, and human action recognition. 
and video analysis.

``Improved Support for Machine-Assisted Ballot-Level Audits,'' Eric Kim, Nicholas Carlini, Andrew Chang, George Yiu, Kai Wang, David Wagner. \emph{EVT/WOTE 2013}, August 2013.
    \begin{itemize}
        \vspace{-0.5em}\item[] Presented improvements to the OpenCount system,
        which significantly reduce operator effort.
        Our new techniques yield order-of-magnitude speedups compared
        to the previous system, and enable us to successfully process some
        elections that would not have reasonably feasible without these
        techniques.
    \end{itemize}
    
``Operator-Assisted Tabulation of Optical Scan Ballots,'' Kai Wang, Eric Kim, Nicholas Carlini, Ivan Motyashov, Daniel Nguyen, David Wagner. \emph{EVT/WOTE 2012}, August 2012.
        \begin{itemize}
        \vspace{-0.5em}\item[] Designed and developed the OpenCount tool, which allows an operator
to efficiently create vote tallies of scanned voted ballots from an election. This is accomplished via a system 
that interleaves Computer Vision algorithms and operator assistance in order to achieve perfect (or near-perfect) accuracy.
Successfully applied the tool on several California pilot audits in 2011. 
        \end{itemize}

``An Analysis of Write-in Marks on Optical Scan Ballots,'' Theron Ji, Eric Kim, Raji Srikantan, Alan Tsai, Arel Cordero, and David Wagner. \emph{EVT/WOTE 2011}, August 2011.
	\begin{itemize}
	\vspace{-0.5em}\item[] Developed a system to achieve automatic recognition of write-in marks on marked voter ballots. Evaluated the system on
				       a large-scale election in Leon County, Florida, and studied the kinds of write-in marks that are seen in practice.

	{Projects with significant scope and technical expertise for the purpose of applying concepts, in addition to
	sharpening programming skills.}

	\begin{itemize}
        \vspace{-0.5em}\item Implemented an efficient barcode decoder
        for the Interleaved 2-of-5 format. (Python, OpenCV)
		\vspace{-0.5em}\item Built a static analysis tool that, given the source code of a program that
		processes attacker-controlled input, finds an input that maximizes execution time, effectively
		creating a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack vector. (C, Gametime tool)
		\vspace{-0.5em}\item Built a Python 2.5 compiler targeting the x86 ISA, with the addition of
		optional strong typing support. (C++, Bison variant, Python)
		\vspace{-0.5em}\item A symbolic music generator that provides harmonically-correct
		parts for SATB voices. Framing the problem as a CSP and as a Dynamic Programming problem led to 
        efficient algorithms.
		(Python)
		\vspace{-0.5em}\item Implemented various key low-level aspects of the 
		educational NachOS operating system, such as demand paging, multi-threading, virtual memory, and 
		networking.
		\vspace{-0.5em}\item Built a spam classifier, utilizing the Naive Bayes probabilistic model in order to make
		learning and inference stages tractable. (Python, numpy)
		\vspace{-0.5em}\item Implemented several AI algorithms for the game of Pacman, utilizing
		techniques such as: graph search, adversarial search, and reinforcement learning. (Python)
